Imagine we have a simple `<span>`, like this:

```html
<span>Click me!</span>
```

And we want to make it look like a button, like this?

<span class="btn btn-lg btn-primary">Click me!</span>

Notice a few things about the styles for this button:

- It has slightly rounded corners.
- It gets subtly darker when you hover over it.
- It gets even darker when you click on it.
- There is an inset shadow effect.

Try to make it happen in [this page](/levels/primary_button). You'll find the code to edit in `app/views/levels/primary_button.html.erb`.

When you're happy with your button, go to [the next exercise](/instructions/other_buttons).
